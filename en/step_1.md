You can move a turtle around the screen using the commands `forward`, `back`, `left`, and `right`. **Note:** Turtles start off in the middle of the screen facing right. 

- This code moves the turtle forward 100 pixels in the direction it is facing. 

```python
turtle.forward(100)
```

You can use `fd` instead of `forward`.

- This code moves the turtle back 100 pixels without changing the direction it is facing:

```python
turtle.back(100)
```

You can also use `bk` instead of `backward`. 

You can change the direction the turtle is facing in using `left` (anti-clockwise) or `right` (clockwise). The amount to turn is given in degrees. 

- Turn right 90 degrees:

```python
turtle.right(90)
``` 

- Turn left 45 degrees:

```python
turtle.left(45)
```
